- 👋 Hi, I’m @Samih-codes
- 👀 I have a background in cryptocurrency trading with over 2 years of experience. Currently, I'm diving into the world of Python and working through a 100 day bootcamp! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OOP and how to use Turtle Graphics to build simple games such as snake and pong.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any beginner to intermediate trading-related projects built on Python. Whether it's developing trading bots, analyzing market data, or creating financial models, I'm excited to work with others who share an interest in the intersection of trading and technology.
